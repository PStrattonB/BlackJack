This was the final assignment for one of my python courses. It is a blackjack game meant to be played from the command line. Rules are as follows:

When the game starts, both you and the dealer are dealt 2 cards. One of the dealer's cards will be hidden.
You will win the game if the total of your cards is higher than the dealer's total without going over 21.
Any ties with the dealer will result in a loss for the player. You can choose to 'hit' to be given another
card, or you can 'stand' to keep the cards you have and allow the dealer to have their turn.

When in the game, type 'Rules' to display these rules again or type y to start the game and n to quit.
